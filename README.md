## 🌐 Overview  
KoTH Defender is an educational Linux Kernel Module (LKM) designed for TryHackMe's "King of the Hill" competitions. This proof-of-concept demonstrates:  

- Defensive kernel programming techniques  
- System monitoring through low-level hooks  
- Stealth mechanisms for competition compliance  
- Attack detection and response patterns  

### **Core Concept:**  
✔️ Demonstrates how kernel modules can monitor/protect systems  
❌ Not designed for real-world security implementations  

## ⚙️ Key Features  
### 🛡️ Defensive Capabilities  
| Feature              | Description                          | Competition Use Case            |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Stealth Monitoring** | Temporary file/process concealment  | Hide competition artifacts from opponents |
| **Port Obfuscation**  | TCP connection filtering          | Protect critical services in KoTH matches |
| **Alert System**      | Unauthorized process detection    | Trigger notifications for suspicious activity |
| **Kernel Protection** | Module self-defense mechanisms   | Resist tampering attempts during matches |

### 🎓 Educational Value  
- **LKM Development Primer:** Learn kernel programming fundamentals  
- **Rootkit Detection Practice:** Study common stealth techniques  
- **System Hardening Lab:** Experiment with kernel-level protections  
- **CTF Analysis Toolkit:** Analyze module behavior in competitions  

## 🔧 Technical Components  
### **Kernel-Level Implementations**  
| Component        | Purpose                         | Learning Focus                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Syscall Hooking**  | Intercept file/process listing  | Rootkit detection patterns  |
| **/proc Control**    | Process visibility manipulation | Linux pseudofilesystem analysis  |
| **TCP Filtering**    | Network connection masking  | Kernel networking stack basics  |
| **Workqueues**      | Background task management  | Kernel threading concepts  |
| **UMH Triggers**    | Userland process spawning  | Kernel-user space interaction  |

## 🖥️ Usage Requirements  
### **Supported Environments:**  
✅ TryHackMe AttackBox  
✅ VirtualBox/KVM Instances  
✅ CTFd Competition Platforms  
❌ Production Systems  
❌ Internet-Facing Machines  
❌ Unauthorized Networks  

## 📥 Installation  
### **1. Compile Module**  
```bash
make
```

### **2. Load Defense Module**  
```bash
sudo insmod koth_defender.ko
```

### **3. Verify Activation**  
```bash
# Check kernel ring buffer
dmesg | grep -i "koth defender initialized"

# Confirm stealth operations
ls -la | grep ${HIDE_PREFIX}  # Should show no results
netstat -tuln | grep ${HIDDEN_PORT}  # Port should be hidden
```

### **4. Match Cleanup**  
```bash
sudo rmmod koth_defender
```

## 🛠️ Pre-Configured Environment  
Assumes the competition system already contains:  
```bash
✔️ Kernel headers matching running kernel
✔️ Basic build tools (make, gcc)
✔️ Standard debugging utilities (dmesg, lsmod)
✔️ Network analysis tools (netstat, ss)
```

## 📜 Competition Protocol  
### **Expected KoTH Workflow**  
#### **Pre-Match: Compile module**  
```bash
make clean && make
```

#### **Match Start: Load defenses**  
```bash
insmod koth_defender.ko
```

#### **During Match: Monitor via**  
```bash
dmesg -w
```

#### **Match End: Remove module**  
```bash
rmmod koth_defender
```

## ⚠️ Disclaimer  
✔️ **Valid ONLY in TryHackMe's isolated KoTH environments**  
❌ **Never attempt on internet-connected systems**  

### **Legal Notice:**  
This software is for **educational use only** in authorized TryHackMe competitions. Misuse violates **computer crime laws** in most jurisdictions.  

### **Features Compliance with TryHackMe KoTH Rules**
